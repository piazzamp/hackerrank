# [ZenHacks 2015](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/zenhacks)

Zenefits hosted this competition in the spirit of recruiting. It's a 24-hour, 14-problem competition in which the top ten contestants are flown out to Zenefits HQ for interviews. Pretty cool, but also kind of hard (as it turns out). There are, I think, math tricks of which I am not aware that allow super efficient solutions to these problems â€“ I mean some of these solutions exceed the time constraints. :rage2:
